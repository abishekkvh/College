# EX8 · Reliable Data Transmission in C

**Exploring how acknowledgements, sequence numbers, and retransmissions turn unreliable delivery into ordered communication.**

This computer networks laboratory exercise implements Stop-and-Wait over UDP and a deterministic Go-Back-N sliding-window simulation. Both make failure recovery visible: a frame is sent, an acknowledgement advances the sender, and a timeout triggers another attempt when delivery fails.

The central engineering trade-off is easy to observe: allowing multiple outstanding frames improves the opportunity for progress, but Go-Back-N may have to resend correctly transmitted frames after an earlier frame is lost.

## Project at a glance

| Protocol | Status | Execution model | What it demonstrates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stop-and-Wait | Implemented | Separate C sender and receiver using UDP | Alternating sequence bits, actual receive timeouts, retries, duplicate suppression |
| Go-Back-N | Implemented | One C program simulating both endpoints | Sliding windows, cumulative ACKs, out-of-order discards, retransmission counts |
| Selective Repeat | Planned | No implementation yet | Future comparison with selective retransmission and receiver buffering |

The receiver filename is currently spelled `reciever.c`; the build commands below match it. Git does not track empty directories, so the Selective Repeat placeholder may not appear in a fresh clone.

## Build and run

### Requirements

- A C compiler supporting C11, such as GCC or Clang.
- macOS, Linux, or a POSIX environment such as WSL for the UDP programs.
- Two terminals for Stop-and-Wait; one terminal for Go-Back-N.

There are no third-party library dependencies. Run the following commands from the **EX8 directory**.

### Go-Back-N: quickest demonstration

```sh
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic Go-Back-N/go_back_n.c -o Go-Back-N/go_back_n
./Go-Back-N/go_back_n
```

Example configuration:

```text
Window size: 4
Number of frames: 10
Frame to lose or corrupt (0 for none): 3
Fault type (1 = lost, 2 = corrupted): 1
```

To reproduce this run without entering values interactively:

```sh
printf '4\n10\n3\n1\n' | ./Go-Back-N/go_back_n
```

### Stop-and-Wait: live UDP demonstration

Build both endpoints:

```sh
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic Stop-and-Wait/reciever.c -o Stop-and-Wait/receiver
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic Stop-and-Wait/sender.c -o Stop-and-Wait/sender
```

Start the receiver in terminal 1:

```sh
./Stop-and-Wait/receiver
```

Start the sender in terminal 2:

```sh
./Stop-and-Wait/sender
```

The sender targets `127.0.0.1:8085`; the receiver binds UDP port `8085` on all local interfaces. Choose a mode, then enter messages:

| Mode | Sender action | Observable result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1` — Normal | Sends one message and waits for its ACK | Receiver accepts the frame; sequence bit alternates |
| `2` — Drop/retry | Marks the first attempt of each message for deliberate receiver-side discard | No ACK arrives; the sender retries after its 3-second receive timeout |
| `3` — Duplicate | Offers to resend a frame after its ACK arrives | Receiver discards the duplicate and returns its current ACK |

Type `exit` at the message prompt to stop the sender. Stop the receiver with `Ctrl+C`.

## How Stop-and-Wait works

The sender permits one outstanding frame. Each frame carries a sequence bit, alternating between `0` and `1`. The receiver maintains the bit it expects next.

1. The sender transmits a frame with its current sequence bit.
2. The receiver accepts the frame only if that bit matches `expected`.
3. After acceptance, the receiver toggles `expected` and sends it as the ACK value.
4. The sender advances only when the received ACK equals `seq ^ 1`.
5. A receive timeout or invalid ACK causes the same frame to be retried.

If an ACK is lost, the sender may transmit a frame that the receiver has already accepted. The unchanged sequence bit lets the receiver suppress duplicate delivery while sending the ACK again. The duplicate mode exposes this receiver behavior directly.

**ACK convention:** in this implementation, an ACK identifies the **next expected sequence bit**. For example, accepting frame bit `0` produces ACK `1`.

## How Go-Back-N works

The Go-Back-N program models a sender and receiver in one process. Frames are numbered from `1` through `N`, and the configured window size `W` limits the number of outstanding frames.

### State and invariants

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `base` | Oldest frame not yet acknowledged |
| `next` | Next frame not yet sent for the first time |
| `expected` | Next frame the receiver will accept |

Outstanding frames occupy `[base, next)`, with `next - base <= W`. The receiver accepts only `expected`, so accepted frames remain contiguous and ordered. Delivery completes when `base > N`.

**ACK convention:** ACK `k` acknowledges every frame through `k`; ACK `0` means no frames have been accepted. This differs from the next-expected-bit convention used by the Stop-and-Wait program.

### Transmission and recovery

1. Send a wave of frames that fits inside the available window.
2. Process receiver responses: accept the next expected frame and discard any out-of-order frame.
3. Advance `base` using cumulative ACKs and fill newly available window slots.
4. If frames remain outstanding and no more frames can be sent, simulate expiration of the oldest frame's timer.
5. Retransmit **every outstanding frame**, beginning at `base`.

The chosen frame fails only on its first attempt. A lost frame produces no receiver response. A corrupted frame is discarded and produces an ACK for the last contiguous frame accepted. Later out-of-order frames produce duplicate ACKs; they do not advance the window or trigger fast retransmit.

Timeouts are logical events: the simulation advances immediately to the timeout rather than sleeping. ACKs are assumed reliable, and corruption is a configured event rather than an actual checksum calculation.

### Worked example: window 4, ten frames, frame 3 lost

| Stage | Frames sent | Receiver outcome | Sender outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial window | `1, 2, 3, 4` | Accepts 1–2; 3 is lost; discards 4 | ACK 2 moves the window base to 3 |
| Fill available slots | `5, 6` | Discards both while waiting for 3 | Outstanding frames are now 3–6 |
| Timeout recovery | `3, 4, 5, 6` | Accepts all four in order | ACKs advance the base to 7 |
| Complete delivery | `7, 8, 9, 10` | Accepts all remaining frames | Every frame is acknowledged |

Frames 5 and 6 are sent before the timeout because ACKs for 1 and 2 open two new window slots. This demonstrates a sliding window rather than independent fixed-size batches.

The program ends with:

```text
Transmission analysis
Frames successfully delivered: 10
Original transmissions: 10
Retransmissions: 4
Timeouts: 1
Total data-frame transmissions: 10 + 4 = 14
Transmission efficiency: 71.43%
```

## Transmission cost and complexity

For this simulation's timing model, let `N` be the frame count, `W` the window size, and `F` the frame that fails once.

```text
No fault:
    retransmissions R = 0

One lost or corrupted frame:
    retransmissions R = min(W, N - F + 1)

Total data-frame transmissions T = N + R
Transmission efficiency         = (N / T) × 100%
```

Every data-frame send attempt counts, including attempts that are lost, corrupted, or discarded. ACK messages are excluded. The efficiency metric measures useful delivered frames per send attempt; it is not measured network throughput or link utilization.

| N | W | Failure | Retransmissions | Total transmissions | Efficiency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 4 | None | 0 | 10 | 100.00% |
| 10 | 4 | Frame 3 | 4 | 14 | 71.43% |
| 10 | 4 | Frame 10 | 1 | 11 | 90.91% |
| 10 | 1 | Frame 3 | 1 | 11 | 90.91% |
| 10 | 20 | Frame 3 | 8 | 18 | 55.56% |

A larger window can increase the number of frames resent after a loss. Its benefit under real network latency is allowing multiple frames to remain in flight; this program does not measure that latency benefit. These counts depend on the documented single-fault and timeout assumptions, rather than being universal counts for every Go-Back-N network.

The simulator performs `O(N + R)` work and uses `O(1)` auxiliary memory. It tracks frame identifiers and counters rather than storing payloads or a retransmission buffer. With the single configured fault, `R <= N`, so runtime is also `O(N)`.

## Validation and reproducible checks

All three C source files were compiled with `-std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` without compiler warnings in the development environment.

The Go-Back-N implementation was also checked with a temporary automated harness across **840 configurations**: frame counts 1–12, window sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, every possible failed-frame position, and both loss and corruption. Checks confirmed ordered, exactly-once acceptance, the expected transmission totals, and timeout counts. Invalid-input recovery and early end-of-input were checked separately. This harness is not currently committed to the repository.

After building, use these commands for a quick regression walkthrough:

```sh
# No fault: 10 total transmissions, 0 timeouts.
printf '4\n10\n0\n' | ./Go-Back-N/go_back_n

# Loss: 14 total transmissions, 1 timeout.
printf '4\n10\n3\n1\n' | ./Go-Back-N/go_back_n

# Corruption: 14 total transmissions, 1 timeout.
printf '4\n10\n3\n2\n' | ./Go-Back-N/go_back_n

# Window size 1: 11 total transmissions, 1 timeout.
printf '1\n10\n3\n1\n' | ./Go-Back-N/go_back_n

# Last-frame loss: 11 total transmissions, 1 timeout.
printf '4\n10\n10\n1\n' | ./Go-Back-N/go_back_n
```

For Stop-and-Wait, run each interactive mode and observe acceptance, timeout recovery, and duplicate rejection in the two terminals. Its runtime behavior is not covered by the Go-Back-N harness.

## Design boundaries

These are focused laboratory implementations with deliberately small protocol models:

- **Go-Back-N:** deterministic one-time failure, reliable ACKs, no payload storage, no sequence-number wraparound, and no real network or elapsed-time measurement. Window size and frame count must be positive integers up to `INT_MAX`; a window larger than the frame count is accepted.
- **Stop-and-Wait:** one sender/receiver session, fixed port and timeout, fixed-size message storage, and a shared in-memory C struct layout sent directly over UDP. There is no portable wire encoding or checksum implementation. The sender retries indefinitely if the receiver never responds.
- **Selective Repeat:** reserved for future work; no selective retransmission or out-of-order buffering is implemented yet.

## Engineering takeaways

- **A timeout signals missing confirmation.** It cannot, by itself, distinguish a lost data frame from a lost ACK.
- **Sequence numbers protect delivery semantics.** They let the receiver recognize retransmitted data and avoid delivering it twice.
- **Cumulative ACKs describe a contiguous prefix.** A later frame cannot advance the receiver past a missing earlier frame in this Go-Back-N model.
- **Recovery policy has a measurable cost.** Discarding out-of-order frames simplifies receiver state but increases retransmission work.
- **Simulation assumptions shape results.** Separating frame-count efficiency from throughput makes the reported measurements interpretable.

## Possible extensions

- Implement Selective Repeat with receiver buffering and individual frame acknowledgements.
- Add configurable ACK loss, multiple failures, and seeded random fault injection.
- Introduce finite sequence-number spaces and test wraparound behavior.
- Build a socket-based Go-Back-N variant with explicit packet serialization and payload integrity checks.
- Commit an automated regression harness and add continuous integration.
- Measure throughput under controlled delay and loss to compare window sizes experimentally.
